# Use: pytest -m integration  for full test suite
# Use: pytest -m slow  for tests needing real BERT model

# For even faster execution, install and enable:
# pip install pytest-xdist pytest-timeout
# Then uncomment these:
# -n auto              # Parallel execution (use all CPU cores)
# --timeout=30         # Kill tests that hang
# --durations=10       # Show 10 slowest tests
